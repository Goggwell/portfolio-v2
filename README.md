# Sams Codex

Portfolio 2.0

Built this portfolio as a more professional approach compared to my first one.
Design was inspired by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com)'s site.

- Front-End Technologies: 
  - Vanilla JS
  - Sass
- Back-End Technologies: 
  - NodeJS
  - Express
  - NodeMailer (for contact form)

Deployed to Heroku ([running site](http://samscodex.herokuapp.com)).
- Bundled with Parcel

Create your own .env with the template provided (.env_sample)
- NodeMailer requires you to use your email user and pass, for more information read the [docs](https://nodemailer.com/about/).

In the form.js file, replace ``INSERT_URL_HERE`` with your domain name.

## TO-DO
- Convert to a React/Gatsby project for blazing fast speeds and to keep everything better organized
- Separate frontend and backend segments (deploy backend to Heroku, frontend to Netlify)
- Buy domain and set up SSL cert
